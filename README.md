# 🧠 Week 4 Assignment: AI in Software Engineering

### **Theme:** *Building Intelligent Software Solutions* 💻🤖

---

## 📘 Overview

This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhances software engineering by automating workflows, improving accuracy, and supporting ethical and intelligent decision-making.

It consists of three key parts:

1. **Theoretical Analysis** – Conceptual understanding of AI applications in software engineering.
2. **Practical Implementation** – Real-world application of AI tools and libraries.
3. **Ethical Reflection** – Addressing fairness, bias, and responsible AI use.
